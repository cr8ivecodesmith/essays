Learning systems today each offer value, but in limited ways. *LMSs and MOOCs* provide structure and scale, but at the cost of flexibility and ownership. *PKMSs*, while not strictly learning tools, help organize notes and thoughts, but lack the guidance and scaffolding needed for practice and progression.

If learning is about connecting ideas through deep thinking and practice, then these systems do not fully support it. We need a way to explore and reason about any type of materials, to refine our thoughts, and build our own mental schema of a subject.

Such a system must support a *refinement cycle* of practice and reflection, allow exploration from multiple angles with feedback, store knowledge in a portable, learner-owned format, and make connections and retrieval intuitive. This system should help us capture what we learn, practice it, and deepen our understanding.


## What Learning Really Needs

Learning Management Systems (LMS) help institutions deliver courses and training programs. They give organizations control over the learning experience, ensuring a standard of delivery.

Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) have democratized knowledge, making courses from top universities available globally at low cost or even free. Both LMSs and MOOCs are evolving with AI, AR/VR, and analytics to offer better collaboration and personalization.

Yet at their core, they remain **institutional systems**. They do not give learners continuity of their knowledge and growth outside the course or platform.

Personal Knowledge Management Systems (PKMS) fill another gap. They help capture and organize thoughts, often evolving into personal wikis that link notes together. Many support powerful formatting, templates, and portable formats, giving full ownership of your data. But as tools for capture and organization, they do not inherently provide **practice, feedback, or guided progression.**

In my own practice, I find myself relying on both. LMSs and MOOCs give me structure, but I rarely study only within their boundaries. Books, articles, videos, podcasts, and lived experiences all feed into the same subject. PKMSs help me record notes from these sources, but they do not help me test my understanding or easily connect across different materials. By design, these systems leave a gap.

That gap is where I find myself in need of something more: a system that combines the best of both, but is rooted in how people actually learn. Such a system should allow learners to:

- **Connect** their thoughts together and link them back to their sources.
- **Practice** and test their understanding.
- **Explore** ideas from multiple angles and get feedback.
- **Own** their knowledge in portable formats.
- **Discover** new connections not visible before.

A Personal Knowledge & Learning System should help us grow — not just capture what we've studied, but shape how we understand and carry that learning forward.


## Learning is About Connections

When information comes in through our senses, the first thing we do is make sense of _what_ it is. Is this good? Dangerous? Familiar? Similar to something I already know? Only after this first act of connection can we think further about what to do with it.

We learn by exerting this mental effort. This is what's known as Cognitive Load: if something feels effortless, it may be because we've already built the mental and physical connections to handle it. If something feels impossibly hard, it may be because the information is too foreign and we haven't yet formed enough connections to make sense of it.

Think of learning a musical instrument like the guitar. At first, your fingers fumble just to hold it properly. With practice, you slow things down, break the motions into smaller steps, and *give your brain time* to wire the movements together. Little by little, it starts to click! The unfamiliar becomes familiar, and the effort begins to feel natural.

Later, when you decide to pick up the piano, the same thing happens — but this time it feels different. You're not starting from scratch. The *mental schema* you built from playing guitar gives you anchors: playing a chord feels like strumming, playing a note feels like plucking a string. Your fingers are stronger and more agile now, so long practice sessions do not tire you as quickly. Little by little, it clicks once more.

Learning lives in that space — not when things are too easy or impossibly hard, but in the middle. That's where each bit of effort lays down new connections.


## Cycles of Improvement

Learning materials come from everywhere: books, videos, articles, online courses, our own notes, even lived experiences and conversations. We take them in through our senses and wrestle with them in our thoughts as we try to make sense of them.

To test and deepen that understanding, we quiz ourselves, write about what we think, run experiments, practice skills, even try to teach others. Along the way, questions and gaps surface. Each loop through these steps fills a gap or answers a question. Bit by bit, a mental schema begins to take shape — the web of connections that makes the subject feel like ours.

It's like a sculptor starting from a rough block of wood: peeling away layers, shaping the form, carving finer details, until a figure emerges.

A Personal Knowledge & Learning System should make this cycle tangible. It should let us gather materials into a subject we want to study, turn them into practice — a quiz, a flashcard, a project — and give us space to record reflections, questions, and notes, linked back to their sources.


## Exploration, With Feedback

One effective way to build a mental schema of a subject is syntopical reading. It means exploring many sources side by side — skimming for keywords, diving deeper into what sparks interest, or reading summaries to see the bigger picture. All the while, you're noting your own thoughts and questions. And often, you look to others — peers, mentors, subject experts — to validate or challenge your assumptions.

It's like a scientist surveying the landscape: reading and researching what's been done, whether directly relevant or only tangential, before forming a hypothesis to guide the next experiment. Or like a traveler preparing for a trip to a new city: scanning guides and blogs, asking friends for tips, piecing together attractions and cultural notes into a mental map. By the time you arrive, you already have a sense of how the place fits together.

A Personal Knowledge & Learning System should do the same. It should help us pull out keywords, generate summaries, and reshape materials into a common format so they can be compared and connected. And while it can't replace a human expert, it should give us ways to reflect on our questions and get feedback grounded in the materials we've collected.


## Owning What We Learn

Learning is a continuous process. Each gap raises a question, each question seeks an answer, each answer develops understanding, each understanding uncovers new gaps. Lessons may come from a passage we read, a quote we heard, a course we took, a conversation, or a realization from practice. These moments arrive at different points over long stretches of time.

Imagine climbing a mountain. The first stretch is gentle, the path relatively flat, the weather pleasant. You think: this is not so bad. But soon the climb steepens. The rain begins, the wind picks up, the fog closes in. You feel discouraged, yet every step also feels like a small victory. When you reach the summit, you're exhausted but proud of what you've overcome. The fog clears — and you realize you've only climbed the first hill. Beyond it, more peaks wait. That's the nature of learning: there is always another ascent.

And just as a climber carries a map and compass for the journey, a Personal Knowledge & Learning System should accompany us on the path toward mastery. It needs to help us anchor our thoughts and realizations back to the materials we study, and hold our knowledge in portable formats — so it remains accessible across time, place, and stage of growth.


## Discovery, and the Work of Recall

As our knowledge grows, it becomes the starting point for new explorations. Each skill we build opens questions about what lies just beyond it. Curiosity leads us to ask: what's possible now? How does this connect to what I already know?

Like a student first learning multiplication. Later, when algebra introduces exponents, they realize multiplication was preparing them all along. Or like a gamer who begins with simple movements — jump, crouch, dash. Later, when the environment changes, those same skills combine into complex maneuvers that feel natural. Both show how what feels basic at first becomes the foundation for something richer later.

A Personal Knowledge & Learning System should do the same. It should resurface what we've already learned when a new subject calls for it, link us back to the original sources, and reveal the connections that tie new discoveries to old ones. That way, discovery ties in recall — and each step deepens the map of what we know.


## A System That Grows With You

Learning is not just courses delivered, tests scored, or dashboards of analytics. LMSs and MOOCs do these things well, and keep improving. Learning also is not just capturing notes or saving lectures into a vault. PKMSs make that easier than ever.

But learning is never isolated. It doesn't come from a single source or happen in a single moment. Instead, it stretches across time, weaving together books, conversations, practices, and realizations.

Learning is connecting ourselves to the ideas and knowledge of others and the world. It is dynamic, continuous, integrative. More importantly, it's deeply personal.
 
That is why I seek to build a system to support this process — one that bears witness to my growth and travels with me throughout a lifetime. That is what I mean by a Personal Knowledge & Learning System — a companion for the long journey of learning.
